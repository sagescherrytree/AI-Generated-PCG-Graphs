- Ideas to add to PCG project:
    - Train some environments on aesthetic score
        - There should be some open source models that rate aestheticness of certain pictures?
        - Train on different environments as well
        - Aestheticness rating model will give each environment a rating
        - Use ratings in discriminator as data
    - Increase number of samples as well
        - May need to train an aestheticness model haha...
